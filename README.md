# NIU Beamer Template (Northern Illinois University)

### Update V2
New Version v2.0 is available. This is based on [*metropolis*](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) theme.

Download it from [here](https://github.com/singh-ramanpreet/niu-beamer/releases).

**Warning for v2**: You need to compile with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX to use the gorgeous Fira fonts.

### How to use it:

Place the **beamerthemeNIU.sty** in the same directory of main tex file and include the following command in your preamble.

```tex
\usetheme{NIU}
```

I have included a example tex file and compiled pdf here.
Enjoy!
